If you want to jump to the part where I have explained how to run this application on your system click <a href="setup">here</a>.

<h2>This Documentiation is divided into three parts</h2>

<h2 id="frontend">Frontend</h2>
<p> The frontend contains three screens namely, Login Page, SignUp Page and Home Page</p>
<p>As the names suggest the Login Page and Signup page contains Login and Signup form. The Home page contains two tabs, Tasks and Board.

<h3><li>Home Page - Tasks - Add Todo</li></h3>
<img src="https://i.ibb.co/4ZjzPMK/tasks-2.png" alt="tasks-2" border="0">
We can simply add a new todo by clicking on the "Add Todo" button.
<h3><li>Home Page - Tasks - Filter Todos</li></h3>
<img src="https://i.ibb.co/GJfpzh1/tasks-3.png" alt="tasks-3" border="0">
In this application we can filters the todos by applying four filters, namely, filter by todo text, due date, labels and priority. In this above image we can see that the first input box of filters contains "des" and only the todos which contain this text are shown. Similarly other filters are also applied. This filtering happens at real time, (no need to press any key or button) and also there is no delay as such.

<h3><li>Home Page - Tasks - Edit Todo</li></h3>
<img src="https://i.ibb.co/y4dBQB6/tasks-4.png" alt="tasks-4" border="0">
We can easily edit todo by just simply clicking on the todo.
Also there is provision to delete todo which is acheived by clicking the corresponding "dustbin" icon of that todo.

<h3><li>Home Page - Board</li></h3>
<img src="https://i.ibb.co/QK1zbz2/board-1.png" alt="board-1" border="0">
When you think of a Task Managment application the first thing that comes to your mind is Kanban board without which every todo app is incomplete. This extra feature has been added to facilitate the user to easily change the status of todos by dragging a todo from one column to another. <b>This satisfying task of dragging a todo from "In Progress" column to "Completed" column has been observed to increase the productivity of the user.</b>

<h3><li>Home Page - Board - drag and drop feature</li></h3>

Also observe that while dragging the todo the application creates a shadow element of that todo in the target column to give the user a preview of the resultant scene.
